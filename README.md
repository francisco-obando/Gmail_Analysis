# Gmail_Analysis

This is an exploration of the data stored by Google regarding my personal inbox. The data is dowloaded from Google and processed and cleaned to find use patterns, common topics, peculiar cases, and distribution of thread length.

This starting point of personal analytics gives people an overview of email use, but can be extended to other data that Google stores from different services, which can show how much info is stored about your online presence.
